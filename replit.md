# Overview

TradeTutor is a comprehensive cryptocurrency trading education platform that combines interactive learning, risk-free simulation, and community engagement. The application serves as a complete trading education ecosystem where users can learn crypto trading fundamentals through structured lessons, practice their skills in a simulated trading environment, track their progress with detailed analytics, and engage with a community of fellow traders.

The platform is designed as a single-page application with a modern, responsive interface that guides users through four main sections: Learn (educational content), Simulate (trading practice), Analyze (performance tracking), and Community (social features).

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability. The application uses Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized builds. 

The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring accessibility and consistent design patterns. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling with a custom design system that includes primary colors, spacing, and responsive breakpoints optimized for the trading education domain.

State management is handled through TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, providing automatic caching, background updates, and optimistic updates for a smooth user experience. The routing is implemented using Wouter, a lightweight client-side router.

## Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API design using Express.js with TypeScript. The server implements a middleware-based architecture with request logging, error handling, and JSON parsing capabilities.

The application uses an in-memory storage pattern (MemStorage class) that implements a comprehensive IStorage interface. This design choice allows for easy testing and development while providing a clear contract for data operations. The storage layer manages six core entities: users, lessons, user progress, portfolios, trades, forum posts, and cryptocurrency prices.

## Database Design
The database schema is defined using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the target database. The schema includes:

- Users table with portfolio tracking capabilities
- Lessons table with hierarchical learning content
- User progress tracking with completion states
- Portfolio management with cryptocurrency holdings
- Trade history with buy/sell operations
- Forum posts for community interaction
- Real-time cryptocurrency price data

The schema uses UUID primary keys and includes proper foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity.

## API Structure
The REST API is organized around resource-based endpoints:

- `/api/lessons` - Educational content management
- `/api/progress` - User learning progress tracking
- `/api/portfolio` - Portfolio and holdings management
- `/api/trades` - Trading simulation operations
- `/api/forum` - Community discussion features
- `/api/prices` - Cryptocurrency price data

Each endpoint supports appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT) with proper error handling and response formatting.

## Authentication and Data Flow
Currently implements a demo user system for development purposes. The application is designed to support user authentication and session management through the storage interface, with plans for proper user registration and login flows.

Data flows from the frontend through TanStack Query to the Express API endpoints, which interact with the storage layer to persist and retrieve data. Real-time features like price updates are handled through polling mechanisms with configurable intervals.
